To use this 'rcfiles' project:

-----------------------------------------------------------------
  It can be installed via an included shell script: INSTALL.sh
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Simply clone the git repository to wherever you'd like to keep it.
Then run the included INSTALL.sh script to have it create the links 
and to modify the primary rc starters.



OR............................................................................
If you prefer Manual Installation mode... 
Just follow these old vague directions:


	ln -s ~/[rcfiles.git.dir]/zshrc ~/.zshrc
	ln -s ~/[rcfiles.git.dir]/bash_profile ~/.bash_profile
	ln -s ~/[rcfiles.git.dir]/vimrc ~/.vimrc
	ln -s ~/[rcfiles.git.dir]/vim ~/.vim

Of course replacing "[rcfiles.git.dir]" with the actual directory you've cloned 
this git repo into if you haven't just moved it to your home dir straight out. 

One note: there's a file named 'my_aliases' referring to a file with mysql db 
connection shortcuts which includes the passwords, hosts, etc. and thus the file i
won't exist for you as it's not part of this repo of files.  

Sooooo... either delete the reference to it, or create your own file in its place,
or not.
