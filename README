To use this 'rcfiles' project:

Simply clone the git repository to wherever you'd like to keep it.
Then run the included INSTALL.sh script to have it create the links 
and to modify the primary rc starters.




OR............................................................................
If you prefer Manual Installation mode... 
Just follow these old vague directions:

	ln -s [rcfiles.git.dir] ~/rcfiles
Of course replacing "[rcfiles.git.dir]" with the actual directory you've cloned this git repo into if you haven't just moved it to your home dir straight out. 

	ln -s ~/rcfiles/zshrc ~/.zshrc
	ln -s ~/rcfiles/bash_profile ~/.bash_profile
	ln -s ~/rcfiles/vimrc ~/.vimrc
	ln -s ~/rcfiles/vim ~/.vim

One note: there's a file named 'my_aliases' referring to a file with mysql db connection shortcuts which includes the passwords, hosts, etc. and thus the file won't exist for you as it's not part of this repo of files.  
Sooooo... either delete the reference to it, or create your own file in its place.
For a quick fix (creating empty file), simply enter:
  touch ~rcfiles/my_aliases
