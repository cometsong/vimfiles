To use this 'rcfiles' project....

-----------------------------------------------------------------
  It can be installed via an included shell script: INSTALL.sh
-----------------------------------------------------------------


OR, if you prefer to do things yourself. 

	ln -s ~/[rcfiles.git.dir]/zshrc ~/.zshrc
	ln -s ~/[rcfiles.git.dir]/bash_profile ~/.bash_profile
	ln -s ~/[rcfiles.git.dir]/vimrc ~/.vimrc
	ln -s ~/[rcfiles.git.dir]/vim ~/.vim

Of course replacing "[rcfiles.git.dir]" with the actual directory you've cloned 
this git repo into if you haven't just moved it to your home dir straight out. 

One note: there's a file named 'my_aliases' referring to a file with mysql db 
connection shortcuts which includes the passwords, hosts, etc. and thus the file i
won't exist for you as it's not part of this repo of files.  

Sooooo... either delete the reference to it, or create your own file in its place.
