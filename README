To use this 'rcfiles' project....

	ln -s [rcfiles.git.dir] ~/rcfiles
Of course replacing "[rcfiles.git.dir]" with the actual directory you've cloned this git repo into 
if you haven't just moved it to your home dir straight out. 

	ln -s ~/rcfiles/zshrc ~/.zshrc
	ln -s ~/rcfiles/bash_profile ~/.bash_profile
	ln -s ~/rcfiles/vimrc ~/.vimrc

One note: there's a file named 'my_aliases' referring to a file with mysql db connection shortcuts
which includes the passwords, hosts, etc. and thus the file won't exist for you as it's not part 
of this repo of files.  Sooooo... either delete the reference to it, or create your own file.
