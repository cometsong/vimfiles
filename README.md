## To use this 'vimfiles' project:

-----------------------------------------------------------------  
To Install, simply clone the git repository to wherever you'd like to keep it.
Then cd to that dir, check/edit the Makefile, and run 'make'

This will delete all links/files that exist in your home dir (or other 
destination) and make new ones from the files in this repo.

**OR**
If your prefer actual files instead of links, then just copy the desired files
to your `$HOME` directory.
